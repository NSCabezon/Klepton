"""Generate the visionOS host app's .xcodeproj with no Xcode GUI needed.

Grown from spikes/device-probe/gen_xcodeproj.py, but data-driven: the guest
libraries are a list, not seven hand-written object ids each. That list — and
the product name, bundle id and display name that go with it — now comes from
visionos/targets.py, keyed on KLEPTON_TARGET. There are two guests, and two apps
built from one tree must not collide: a bundle ID separates the INSTALLED apps
and nothing about their build outputs, so the target carries the product name
(hence the .xcodeproj, the .app and the derived-data directory) and the
Frameworks/ subdirectory its translations were staged into.

What the app links, and why it comes from three places:

  Klepton.xcframework   the C runtime, built by `make xros` (both slices).
                        Static, so it is inside the app binary and carries no
                        load-time cost of its own.
  <guest>.xcframework   the five klepton-ld translations, built by mkguest.sh.
                        Embedded and signed-on-copy, NOT linked — nothing
                        references their symbols; the runtime dlopens them by
                        path. Linking them would make dyld resolve an exports
                        trie that klepton-ld deliberately does not emit.
  ANGLE_*.xcframework   ANGLE retargeted to visionOS, built by mkangle.sh.
                        Embedded the same way and for the same reason: kl_glfb
                        dlopens libEGL/libGLESv2 by path, and linking a renderer
                        the app never names would only make dyld load it on
                        every run, including the ones that stay on the null
                        driver.
  Sources/              the Swift app layer and kl_app.c.

# Klepton.entitlements — the two memory capabilities (see that file for what
# they buy and why this app wants them). **On by default: they fixed the
# loading-transition kills on device, so a build without them is the unusual
# one.**
#
# KLEPTON_ENTITLEMENTS=0 detaches them, and the reason to keep that escape hatch
# is that this is an account setting as much as a build setting. Both keys need
# an EXPLICIT App ID with the capabilities enabled on it; the team's *wildcard*
# profile cannot carry capabilities at all, and attaching them to one does not
# degrade — it fails the build outright:
#
#   error: Provisioning profile "iOS Team Provisioning Profile: *" doesn't
#          support the Extended Virtual Addressing and Increased Memory Limit
#          capability.
#   error: Failed Registering Bundle Identifier: the app identifier
#          "…dev.klepton.target.beatsaber" cannot be registered to your
#          development team
#
# That pair of errors means the App ID is not set up, not that the entitlements
# are wrong. Enable both capabilities on it (Xcode > Settings > Accounts, or the
# developer portal) — or build with KLEPTON_ENTITLEMENTS=0 to get moving without
# them, at the cost of the memory headroom.
#
# The SECOND error has another cause worth telling apart, and it is why the id
# carries $USER (targets.py, bundle_for): an App ID belongs to exactly one team,
# so an UNSCOPED id is registered by whoever builds first and refused to everyone
# else — the same sentence, about a name already spoken for rather than about
# capabilities. If it appears with a scoped id, it really is the App ID setup.
ENTITLEMENTS = os.environ.get("KLEPTON_ENTITLEMENTS", "1") != "0"

# ...and the keys that are NOT self-service, each with its own escape hatch.
#
# The two memory keys above are safe to attach unconditionally: Xcode's own
# capability database knows them, they are enabled by ticking a box, and
# automatic signing adds them to the App ID on the next build. A key that is
# granted by REQUEST — or that the toolchain does not recognise at all — is on a
# completely different footing, because attaching one does not degrade. It fails
# the whole signing step, which takes the memory keys down with it, and those
# are what stopped the loading-transition kills. That is why
# `com.apple.developer.networking.multicast` was removed outright once the
# broadcast fan-out in kl_shim.c made it unnecessary.
#
# So a risky key gets a knob rather than a second authored file — two entitlement
# files that have to agree is exactly how they stop agreeing. The authored file
# is the union; the knob FILTERS a generated copy.
#
#   com.apple.developer.low-latency-streaming (KLEPTON_LOW_LATENCY=0 drops it)
#       Added at the user's request while chasing a streaming regression. Note
#       honestly what is and is not known about it: this key does not appear in
#       the XROS SDK or in Xcode's Library tree — but neither do the two memory
#       keys, which certainly do work, so that search is INCONCLUSIVE and not
#       evidence the key is wrong. If the build starts failing with "doesn't
#       include the com.apple.developer.low-latency-streaming entitlement" (a
#       grant you must be given) or with an unknown-entitlement error (a key the
#       platform does not know), set KLEPTON_LOW_LATENCY=0 and the memory keys
#       survive. Do not diagnose a stream problem from its presence alone —
#       runtime/xr/kl_openxr.c's KL_XR_PROFILE is the A/B for the change that
#       actually altered what the client publishes.
